# Shadow Dismissable

For this exercise, you will be using the Shadow DOM and HTML Template Tags to
create a simple way to offer dismissable content on a page.

**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes

## Requirements

1. All elements on the page with class `dismissable` should have a "Close"
   button inserted at the top right corner of the element. The element should
   also be given an outline to indicate its boundaries.
2. When the "Close" button is clicked, the element should be hidden using
   `display: none`.
3. You may not in any way alter the DOM (either manually or using JavaScript)
   other than writing in the `<script>` tag and `<template>` tag provided.
   
### Optional Bonus Requirements

1. If the element in question has a `title` attribute, display the title
   and close button in a "title bar" at the top of the element.
