        # Some Sample Markdown
        
        Why hello good sir! It appears that you are marking some content
        down for ease of writing. "Tally ho!"
        
        1. Remember that Polymer is still in alpha, things might get hairy.
        2. This is another item because we'd like to have some content, no?
        
        Did you know that the [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) library supports GitHub-flavored markdown?
        
        ```js
        // this is some javascript code
        alert("neato");
        ```
      </markdown-content>
